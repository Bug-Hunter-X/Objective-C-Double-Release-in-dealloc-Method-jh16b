In Objective-C, a rare but impactful error stems from the misuse of the `retain` and `release` methods (or their modern equivalents, `strong` and `weak` properties) within custom `dealloc` methods.  Specifically, if an object attempts to release an object that's already been deallocated (a double-release), it can lead to crashes or unpredictable behavior. This is particularly tricky because the crash might not occur immediately but much later, making debugging challenging.

Example of problematic code:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    [myString release]; // Potentially dangerous if myString is already deallocated
    [super dealloc];
}
@end
```

This is more problematic in scenarios with complex object graphs and asynchronous operations.
