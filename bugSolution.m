The solution focuses on ensuring that an object is only released once, preventing double releases. One approach is to use Objective-C's Automatic Reference Counting (ARC), or to use methods like `weak` properties, to remove the need for manual release in most situations.  In cases where manual memory management is unavoidable, checks can be implemented:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    if (myString) { // Check if myString is still valid
        [myString release];
    }
    [super dealloc];
}
@end
```

Alternatively, using ARC significantly reduces the risk:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
// dealloc is not necessary with ARC; the system will handle memory management
@end
```

Remember that using ARC is the recommended approach in modern Objective-C development.
